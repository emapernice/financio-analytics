# Financio Analytics

This project provides an analytical layer over the database of **Financio**, a personal finance management system.  
The goal is to extract, transform, and analyze financial records using **SQLAlchemy**, **pandas**, and **python-dotenv**, following best practices suitable for a Data Analyst portfolio.

## Project Structure
- `etl/` — ETL scripts (extract, transform, load)
- `src/` — Python source code (configuration, database, models, utilities)
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks for exploration and visualizations
- `data/` — raw and processed datasets (excluded from Git to protect sensitive data)
